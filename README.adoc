The Redis Cloud Autoscaler helps you to scale your Redis Cloud instances to new Memory / throughput limits based on current usage or a pre-set schedule.

== Architecture Overview

image:autoscaler-architecture.png[Redis Cloud Autoscaler Architecture]

The Redis Cloud Autoscaler is and application designed to run in your own environment, it will scale your Redis Cloud in / out based one of two trigger types

1. **Prometheus Alerts** You can configure your Prometheus Alert Manager ot send webhook alerts to the Redis Cloud Autoscaler, the Autoscaler's rule-based scaling system will then scale your Redis Cloud instance out / in based off of the alerts it receives.
2. **Scheduled Scaling** You can configure the Redis Cloud Autoscaler to scale your Redis Cloud instance out / in based on a schedule you define.

== Configuration

=== Redis Cloud Autoscaler Config Items

[options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description
| REDIS_HOST_AND_PORT | The private endpoint of the Redis Cloud subscription database.
| REDIS_PASSWORD | The password for accessing the Redis Cloud database.
| REDIS_CLOUD_API_KEY | The API key for interacting with Redis Cloud services.
| REDIS_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_KEY | The account key for authenticating with Redis Cloud.
| REDIS_CLOUD_SUBSCRIPTION_ID | The ID of the Redis Cloud subscription.
| ALERT_MANAGER_HOST | The public IP address of the Prometheus Alert Manager instance.
| ALERT_MANAGER_PORT | The port on which Alert Manager is running (default: 9093).
|===

=== Defining Rules

The Redis Cloud Autoscaler uses a JSON-based rule system to define how a given Redis Cloud Database should be scaled.

[options="header"]
|===
| Field Name | Type | Required | Description
| `dbId` | String | Yes | The Redis Cloud Database ID.
| `ruleType` | String | Yes | This is the type of rule - `IncreaseMemory`, `DecreaseMemory`, `IncreaseThroughput`, `DecreaseThroughput`.
| `scaleType` | String | Yes | The way the new scale will be calculated - `Deterministic`, `Step`, `Exponential`.
| `triggerType` | String | Yes | The way a scaling operation will be triggered - `webhook`, `scheduled`.
| `triggerValue` | cron | No | Value that triggers the scaling action - currently only pertinent for scheduled triggers, the cron expression to schedule the scaling operation.
| `scaleValue` | double | Yes | The value used to scale the Redis Cloud instance in / out. For `Exponential` scaleType, this is the value to multiply by. For memory rules this is in gb, for throughput rules this is in ops/sec.
| `scaleCeiling` |  | No | The limit to which the Redis Cloud instance can be scaled out to.
| `scaleFloor` |  | No | The minimum limit to which the Redis Cloud instance can be scaled in to.

==== Sample Rules:

Rule to increase memory to 1gb for a Redis Cloud Database with ID `123456`:
[source,json]
----
{
  "dbId": "123456",
  "ruleType": "IncreaseMemory",
  "scaleType": "Deterministic",
  "scaleValue": 1,
  "scaleCeiling": 1,
  "triggerType":"webhook"
}
----

Rule to decrease memory to 0.5gb for a Redis Cloud Database with ID `123456`:
[source,json]
----
{
  "dbId": "123456",
  "ruleType": "DecreaseMemory",
  "scaleType": "Deterministic",
  "scaleValue": 0.5,
  "scaleFloor": 0.5,
  "triggerType":"webhook"
}
----

Rule to double the throughput for a Redis Cloud Database with ID `123456`:
[source,json]
----
{
  "dbId": "123456",
  "ruleType": "IncreaseThroughput",
  "scaleType": "Exponential",
  "scaleValue": 2,
  "scaleCeiling": 100000,
  "triggerType":"webhook"
}
----

Rule to Scale Redis to 50gb at 7:00am every weekday:
[source,json]
----
{
  "dbId": "123456",
  "ruleType": "IncreaseMemory",
  "scaleType": "Deterministic",
  "scaleValue": 50,
  "scaleCeiling": 50,
  "triggerType":"scheduled",
  "triggerValue":"0 7 * * 1-5"
}
----

Rule To Scale Redis up 3 GB:
[source,json]
----
{
  "dbId": "123456",
  "ruleType": "IncreaseMemory",
  "scaleType": "Step",
  "scaleValue": 3,
  "scaleCeiling": 50,
  "triggerType":"webhook"
}
----

== Limitations

* The Redis Cloud Autoscaler is currently only available for Redis Cloud Pro Subscriptions
* The Redis Cloud Autoscaler will currently only scale a database in (down) deterministically (`Deterministic` is the only valid setting for `DecreaseMemory` and `DecreaseThroughput`)

== Availability

=== Docker
The Redis Cloud Autoscaler is available as a Docker image, you can pull the image from GitHub's Docker registry:

[source,shell]
----
docker pull ghcr.io/redis-field-engineering/redis-cloud-autoscaler:latest
----

=== Jars
You can also download the JAR file from the https://github.com/redis-field-engineering/redis-cloud-autoscaler/releases/latest[GitHub Releases Page]

=== Source
You can of course also build the whole thing from source by cloning this repo and running:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew build
----

== Quickstart

To get started with the Redis Cloud Autoscaler, you can follow the steps in the `quickstart` folder.
