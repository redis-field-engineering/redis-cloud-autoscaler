The Redis Cloud Autoscaler helps you to scale your Redis Cloud instances to new Memory / throughput limits based on current usage or a pre-set schedule.

== Architecture Overview

image:autoscaler-architecture.png[Redis Cloud Autoscaler Architecture]

The Redis Cloud Autoscaler is and application designed to run in your own environment, it will scale your Redis Cloud in / out based one of two trigger types

1. **Prometheus Alerts** You can configure your Prometheus Alert Manager ot send webhook alerts to the Redis Cloud Autoscaler, the Autoscaler's rule-based scaling system will then scale your Redis Cloud instance out / in based off of the alerts it receives.
2. **Scheduled Scaling** You can configure the Redis Cloud Autoscaler to scale your Redis Cloud instance out / in based on a schedule you define.

=== Defining Rules

The Redis Cloud Autoscaler uses a JSON-based rule system to define how a given Redis Cloud Database should be scaled.

|===
| Field Name | Type | Required | Description
| `dbId` | String | Yes | The Redis Cloud Database ID.
| `ruleType` | String | Yes | This is the type of rule - `IncreaseMemory`, `DecreaseMemory`, `IncreaseThroughput`, `DecreaseThroughput`.
| `scaleType` | String | Yes | The way the new scale will be calculated - `Deterministic`, `Step`, `Exponential`.
| `triggerType` | String | Yes | The way a scaling operation will be triggered - `webhook`, `scheduled`.
| `triggerValue` | cron | No | Value that triggers the scaling action - currently only pertinent for scheduled triggers, the cron expression to schedule the scaling operation.
| `scaleValue` | double | Yes | The value used to scale the Redis Cloud instance in / out. For `Exponential` scaleType, this is the value to multiply by. For memory rules this is in gb, for throughput rules this is in ops/sec.
| `scaleCeiling` |  | No | The limit to which the Redis Cloud instance can be scaled out to.
| `scaleFloor` |  | No | The minimum limit to which the Redis Cloud instance can be scaled in to.
